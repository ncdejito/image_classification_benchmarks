## image classification benchmarks

*testing scripts from [PyTorch Vision Benchmarks](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/classification)*

Pretrained: Yes
Pre-processing: imagenet routines
Other details:
- based on pytorch vision benchmarks
- allows experimentation with hyperparameters via CLI command
- can potentially work with low power devices because of CPU-capable inferencing and compatibility with MobileNetV3 architecture
- pytorch more modifiable vs FastAI or any out of the box solution
